# How much do i need
This is something that I found to myself doing a lot just using a calculator and brain power.

So instead of do it the normal way I wrote a program that did all the work for me.

### Currently

This calculates your current mark based off your class syllabus and current known grades (stored in the various csv files)

It has the option to fill in missing grades or rewrite the grades entirely.

### Eventually

I want to add functionality for (in order of time):
- Calculation of how high a grade is needed for a certain assignment in order to achieve a final grade of some amount (ex. How much do I need on the final worth 30% of my grade if I have a current grade of 70% to get 85%?)
- Change all of this into a published android app that anyone can use

Thanks for reading,
