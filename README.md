# How much do i need
This is something that I found to myself doing a lot just using a calculator and brain power.

So instead of do it the normal way I wrote a program that did all the work for me.

### Currently

This calculates your current mark based off your class syllabus and current known grades (stored in the various csv files)

It has the option to fill in missing grades or rewrite the grades entirely.

It can calculate of how high a grade is needed for a certain assignment in order to achieve a final grade of some amount (ex. How much do I need on the final worth 30% of my grade if I have a current grade of 70% to get 85%?)

Added the ability to add your own csv files and have those options show up in the main screen

### Eventually

I want to add functionality for (in order of time):
- Learn how to develop android
- Change all the methods to java
- Turn this into a published android app that anyone can use

Check out my progress at <a href="https://github.com/MildlySpicy/Art3mis"> this github repository</a>.

# Instructions

1. Download/Copy the python code, everything is contained in the "grade.py" file
2. Run it in a compiler (using python 3.6 or higher)
3. Follow on screen instructions
4. Do well in your classes

Thanks for reading,
