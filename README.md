# How much do i need
This is something that I found to myself doing a lot just using a calculator and brain power.

So instead of do it the normal way I wrote a program that did all the work for me.

### Currently

This just calculates your current mark based off your class syllabus and current known grades (stored in the various csv files) 


### Eventually

I want to add functionality for (in order of time):
- Having more control over changing grades and adding in new grades instead of rewriting it everytime I want to change it.
- Calculation of how high a grade is needed for a certain assignment in order to achieve a final grade of some amount (ex. How much do I need on the final worth 30% of my grade if I have a current grade of 70% to get 85%?)
- Change all of this into a published android app that anyone can use

Once again, Thanks for reading,

Jason
